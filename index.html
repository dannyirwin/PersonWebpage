        <p>Hello!</p>

        <p> I am a young professional making the transition from a career in the fine arts into the world of software development.</p>
        <p> With a veracious love of learning and a variety of professional skills, I pride myself on bringing creative solutions to all my work. While my background and formal education is in the fine arts, I have a deep love of acquiring and improving new skills. To that end, I have found software development the perfect marriage both creative and technical problem solving. Whether working in customer service, on the stage, or in development, I take an "audience" centric approach: how does everything that I do, big or small, contribute to the user's experience.
        </p>

                        <b>Sightless VR</b> is a completely auditory and haptic VR experience for Oculus. I was approached by my good friend and development mentor who had the initial idea. The experience is fairly simple: navigate through a 3D space using only the sounds around you and the haptic vibration from the controllers to get your bearings. In the space, there are randomly placed obstacles, enemies on patrol who will give chase, and mines scattered about. It was built using Unreal Engine and currently under review on the Oculus store
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was my first experience developing with somebody else which proved to be extremely educational. I was able to learn about version and source management on a team, readability and documentation, and collaborative problem solving. It was also invaluable to see how a professional might work through the entire development process from initial concept meetings to publishing. Our personal goals with this project was to see how well we can work together, experiment with visualless feedback in VR, and to see the project all the way through publication.</p>
                    <p>
                        Along with working on the mines and enemies, my main responsibility was the sound and music managers, as well as composing and producing the music itself. One key feature which provided an interesting challenge for me was the dynamic music. As an indication of how far the player is to the exit, the music itself changes to more or less complicated melodies. It was a lovely opportunity to use music theory and composition tricks to solve programmatic issues, and visa versa.

                        <b>The Fame Game</b> is my run at building a web-based idle clicker game. The basic premise is that the player is attempting to accumulate "Fame" by slowing building up different kinds of followers and fans. Each type of follower generates "Fame" which serves as a currency to purchase more followers which then compound.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project was built only using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Jquery. One major development goal of the project was to be able to easily add and remove different followers and having all of their UI elements be generated programmatically. One of the features is a custom follower tab where the user can input the title and properties of a new follower and have it appear in the game with all the necessary buttons and display information. Another problem I found interesting to solve was converting the very large numbers to shorter notation to fit in the UI elements. For example, it would display a number like 10 Billion--or 10,000,000,000.00--to 10.00B using log10 and other arithmetic functions. This was also my introduction of using CSS Flexbox to keep the UI elements organized in a pleasing way as elements were added, subtracted, and sorted.

                        This <b>Driving Schedule Generator</b> was my first project outside the ones assigned by the FreeCodeCamp courses I used to learn web development. I had been hired as an actor on a national childrns' theatre tour where the entire company, including actors, were responsible for driving a set van and passenger van all over the country. We used this app to schedule hundreds of hours and thousands of miles of driving.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This app was designed to use a variety of rules to generate a fair and balanced driving schedule. These rules took into account how often somebody had driven a vehicle, who had worked as a navigator, building in rest shifts, and pairing drivers and navigators evenly. I achieved this by assigning each rule a numerical weight and scoring the most viable permutations against each other. Troubleshooting the schedule was difficult but very interesting as the patterns that developed were not always as expected and could wade into some pretty high-level math theory waters. </p>

                        I quite enjoyed working on this at the time.  Creating the game AI was a wonderful challenge. On each turn, the AI plays out all possible positions and weights them based on how likely that move position will help it to win.  This also meant I had to determine a win state.  I did this by grouping the 3 x 3 grid into nested arrays and checked for complete sets.  These techniques are what inspired me to solve the aforementioned <b>Driving Schedule Generator</b> logic.

                    </p>
                    <p>The main challenges I solved with this project were twofold: sequencing the playing of the Simon sounds so they didn't overlap, and disabling user interaction while the sequence was playing.  This was my first time dealing with the SetTimeout function and using functions that can call themselves. I was able to use these time delays to disable and re-enable player interaction on a toggle fairly easily.  While a simple project, it was a useful way to learn principles that would be important in future projects.</p>

                        This is the first projecte that really used JavaScript to do any of the heavy lifting.  It may be simple, but it was important to me that it not only worked as a user would expect a calculator to work, but to make its interface pleasing and responsive. It was inspired by old school solar-powered pocket calculators, back when smartphones were still science fiction.
